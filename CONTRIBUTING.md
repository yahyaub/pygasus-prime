# Contributing to pygasus-prime
Thank you so much for your contribution!

Before you contribute, you need to hold a single thought:
**Everything should be focused on making video game prototypes quickly.**

pygasus-prime concerns itself with simplicity. Features are abstract enough to either be applied to general game making or to help make games of a certain genre.

When one uses pygasus, they should feel like they are building with magic.

## Ideas
All pull requests for features, fixes or improvements are welcome!

I will occassionally raise issues that you are free to pick up; all you need to do is include the issue number in your branch name.

## Bugs
Please raise an issue for any bugs you find, even if you won't be the one to fix them.

## Comments
I prefer to keep comments to a minimum.
I will be happy to read your explanatory comments in order to understand your contribution better, so please move them into the description.
