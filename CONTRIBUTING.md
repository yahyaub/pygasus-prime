# Contributing to pygasus-prime
Thank you so much for your contribution!

Before you contribute, you need to hold a single thought:
Everything should be focused on making prototypes quickly.

pygasus-prime concerns itself with simplicity. When one uses pygasus, they should feel like they are building with magic.
A feature should be abstract enough that it can either be applied to general game making or to help make games of a certain genre.

## Existing ideas
The easiest way to contribute is to pick up any issues I have raised that make up my TODO list.

Indicate that you desire to work on an issue, and make a pull request. It's that easy!

It doesn't matter if someone else has started working on it. All contributions are welcome.

## New ideas
Simply make a pull request with a clear description (No need to create an issue).
The title should start with `New Feature: ` followed by a summary of what's coming in eg `New Feature: Add animation for board games`

If you're unsure about an idea, you may like to open up a discussion first under Ideas.

## Bugs
Any bugs should at least have an issue raised, even if you won't be the one to fix them.

By bringing up an issue to be looked at is a great way to contribute to this project's development and growth, so thank you in advance!

## Comments
I prefer to keep comments to a minimum.
I will be happy to read your explanatory comments in order to understand your contribution better, so please move them into the description.

## Code of Conduct
1. Please keep it nice and professional when contributing to this project.
2. Please encourage others by providing constructive criticism (if any)
3. Do not harrass another person in any way, shape or form
4. Do not share any sensitive or personal information (even of yourself!)
