# pygasus-prime
Video game prototype framework built using PyGame
Built for game developers

No need for a GUI when you can go straight to writing the game logic.
Make 2D protoypes with ease and focus on making your games fun to play.

Simply run the new game script in your terminal:
```
$ ./new_game.sh path/to/game/folder
```

Note: Documenting the source code for it to be easily used is still a WIP
